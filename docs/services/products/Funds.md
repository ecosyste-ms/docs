### Curated Support For Your Critical Software Dependencies.

Ecosystem Funds provides a simple 'turnkey' solution for funding your critical open source software dependencies, turning [a process that can take months](https://opensource.microsoft.com/blog/2024/06/27/5-things-we-learned-from-sponsoring-a-sampling-of-our-open-source-dependencies/) into a five minute conversation with your CTO.

### Supporting the software we use, not just the software we see 
 
Building an empirically complete picture of your software's 'deep dependencies' can take months of investigative work and analysis to uncover projects that are looking for your support, and to get it to them. 
 
But, fundamentally, you know what technologies you utilise... right? 
 
ecosyste.ms is built on Ruby, Rails, Postgres, Sidekiq, and APISIX. With a broad understanding of the technologies we depend upon it should be possible to hand the responsibility of getting financial support to the packages, and the people behind them to someone. Right? Well, now you can. 
 
### How It Works 
 
_Sponsor the technology you rely on, we'll do the rest._
 
No, really, we mean it. You select one or more open source ecosystems and donate a single or recurring sponsorship. We handle everything else. 
 
We'll direct your money (minus a 10% management fee) to the right people, using the tools projects _themselves_ have chosen to manage their finances. We support funding through GitHub Sponsors, Thanks.dev, StackAid, LF Community Bridge, and of course Open Collective. If a project hasn't listed a funding source, we invite maintainers to collect their donation on behalf of their community, or to let us know where they would like to do so. If they still don't accept your donation, it will be redistributed to the fund for other projects. This process will continue monthly, supported by our amazing team. 

### Getting Started

Find an ecosystem [using our search](https://funds.ecosyste.ms/funds/all) and donate a single or recurring sponsorship. 

We handle everything else: we'll direct your money (minus a 10% management fee) to maintainers, using the tools they have chosen to manage their finances. We allocate 100% of the donations in every fund with a balance of $1,000 or more, on a monthly basis. Every donation and payment is traceable through both Ecosystem Funds and Open Collective. 

Donations can be made directly through [funds.ecosyste.ms](https://funds.ecosyste.ms) or, if you have an account, on Open Collective. Companies who wish to make a large donation, or start a Fund of their own, can [request an Invoice from Open Source Collective](mailto:hello@oscollective.org) — who are already an approved vendor to most large open-source-supporting organisations.
