An open API service providing package, version and dependency metadata of many open source software ecosystems and registries.

## Use this service to...

* Access package information from thousands of sources in a standard format
* See how well used a package is, by other packages (transient dependencies) and repositories (direct dependencies)
* Find all packages that depend on a specific library to assess impact of breaking changes
* Identify unmaintained packages by checking last release date across ecosystems
* Find alternative packages by exploring reverse dependencies and similar patterns
* Find all packages published by an organization
* Compare package versions to understand what changed in an update
* Understand the merge rate of dependabot updates of your library
* Track if your breaking changes are causing users to stick with old versions
