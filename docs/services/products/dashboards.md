Our [Ecosystem Funds](https://funds.ecosyste.ms) product provides a way to support all your critical software dependencies, turning [a process that can take months](https://opensource.microsoft.com/blog/2024/06/27/5-things-we-learned-from-sponsoring-a-sampling-of-our-open-source-dependencies/) into a five minute conversation with your CTO.

But what happens a year later, when you need to justify that investment?

### Measuring What Matters

We know that many of the organisations supporting open source today do so on the basis of indirect benefits. They point to marketing, showing that sponsorship of a popular package will expose their brand to developers, they tell HR that hiring and retaining developers is easier when they know their organisation is giving back. But they rarely talk to engineering about the *direct* benefits of supporting open source projects. 

We want to change that. 

Ecosystem Dashboards are designed to shift the conversation toward the benefits (and thus the budgets) *directly* associated with creating vibrant, productive and sustainable open source communities on which we can all depend.

### Get Started

Head to [dashboards.ecosyste.ms](https://dashboards.ecosyste.ms) and under a GitHub repository. Next you'll see a single project or a ‘collection’ into eight facets:

**Productivity:** How well is this community working together?  
**Responsiveness:** How well is this community able to deal with the pressures placed upon it by users?  
**Finance:** What resources does this community have at their disposal, and how are they using them?  
**Engagement:** How well is the community distributing its workload, and is the community growing?  
**Adoption:** How critical is this community to the ecosystem(s) they’re a part of, and how popular are they?  
**Dependencies:** What software does this community depend upon, and how are those communities doing?
**Packages:** What software does this community publish, and how popular are those artifacts?
**Security:** How well is this community handling security threats, and what tools do they use to do so?

### Collections and SBOMs

We call a group of project a Collection, you can [create a Collection from a GitHub organisation, an Open Collective, or an SBOM](https://dashboards.ecosyste.ms/collections/new). To create a Collection you'll need to login or register an account. Collections can be public (anyone can see them) or private (for your eyes only). Once you've created an account you can also add single project to 'your projects'.

### Who Created Ecosystem Dashboards?

Ecosystem Dashboards are a **free** resource for maintainers, program managers, researchers and policymakers, developed with financial support from [Open Source Collective](https://oscollective.org).
