ecosyste.ms is a set of free services and tools for developers, researchers and policymakers to help identify, secure and sustain open source software.

## Rate limits

In order to maintain a responsive service it's necessary for us to limit users making a high volume of requests over a short time. [Read more about rate limiting](./rate-limits). We provide higher rate limits still for commercial users. [Read more about commercial use](./commercial).

## Authentication

Our services are accessible to anonymous users. Users who identify themselves with a user agent or API key receive a higher rate limit. [Read more about authentication](./authentication)
