An open API service providing package, version and dependency metadata of many open source software ecosystems and registries.

## Use this service to...

* ...find all packages that depend on a specific library to assess impact of breaking changes
* ...identify unmaintained packages by checking last release date across ecosystems
* ...find alternative packages by exploring reverse dependencies and similar patterns
* ...find all packages published by an organization
* ...compare package versions to understand what changed in an update
* ...understand the merge rate of dependabot updates of your library
* ...track if your breaking changes are causing users to stick with old versions
