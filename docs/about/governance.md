TSC: Technical Steering Committee

## Members

Members take an active role in the maintenance, governance, and direction through the following governance procedures. 

New members will be admitted by the project governing committee on a regular basis.  

All members will follow the code of conduct. Changes to the code of conduct will be approved by the project governing committee. 

A member may be removed by an ordinary resolution of the project governing committee. A removed member may be reinstated by the usual admission process.

Sponsoring organisations may be invited to join as a member through a single representative. That representative will be admitted as a member by the usual admission process. Sponsorship does not guarantee admission.

## Project Governing Committee (PGC)

The governing committee is responsible for the financial administration, organisation, and management of project resources. In addition the governing committee will maintain and enforce a code of conduct, admit and remove members, convene general meetings and solicit input and feedback from members to the technical steering committee.

The PGC will have no fewer than three and no more than fifteen members.

The PGC will report meeting participants and minutes, including all decisions made to all members.

## Technical Steering Committee (TSC)

The technical steering committee is responsible for the technical direction and the resolution of technical disputes between maintainers. In addition the TSC will publish and maintain a roadmap to support work by all members. the TSG does not explicitly approve or reject individual proposals or contributions to the project. 

The TSC will have no fewer than three and no more than five members.

Any member may refer any technical question or dispute to the TSC. Members will make a good faith effort to resolve any disputes. 

## Maintainers 

Maintainers are members with commit/write access to at least one ecosyste.ms repository. All maintainers are automatically members. 

New maintainers can be nominated by any existing maintainer. A nomination requires an approval from a member of the TSC before being admitted by the PGC.

Maintainers' access will be reviewed regularly by the TSC, maintainers' access may be revoked due to inactivity and a motion to remove the member may be passed to the PGC. Members will be notified in both cases. 

In emergency situations, including malicious activity by a member, any other member with the ability to do so should remove any and all access and inform the PGC and TSC. 

If a maintainer wishes to appeal their removal they may request a TSC review of the decision. This appeal must be lodged within 72 hours of removal.

## Elections

New members will be admitted to committees by majority vote of all current members on their respective committees.

## Meetings

A general meeting may be called by a majority vote of the PGC or by two-thirds of all members.

## Voting

Should members be unable to reach consensus, decisions can be made by majority vote of affected members. The PGC is responsible for administrating a fair voting process and enforcing the outcome.

## Amendments

Any member may propose an amendment to these bylaws via pull request on GitHub against this document. The PGC will review such proposals, notify affected members and establish consensus for or against the change as above.
